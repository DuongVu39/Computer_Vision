This is the folder storing all exploration of Computer Vision techniques and libraries



## [1st notebook](Exploration_of_CV): Image Classification of Dog and Cat

![](assets/thumbnail.gif)

- Displaying image using Matplotlib, PIL and OpenCV

- Exploring the training and test set

- Creating Convolution Neural Network and test with some validation image

-  Using TensorBoard to track the process.

  

## 2nd notebook: Object Detection and Feature Engineer



- Manually detect object in an image
- Extract features from an image - potentially for prediction purpose.



### 3rd notebook: Good boys classification

- Dog Breed Classification
